2 files the first is a binary that do something
passing it arg 11111
you get 12345

second is a token but unreadable cause of unknown chara
we can expect the file to be encrypted by level09 binary

you cand o it with hands by going trough ascii table and 
hexdump -b token (octal values)
hexdump -c token (characteres)
man ascii


making a script/code to undecipher it is easier en safer as you wont have trouble reading

./a.out `cat token`
python script.py `cat token`
