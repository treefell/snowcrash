we have a binary and a file named token
you can't cat token 
binary ask a file to open and read
trying to open token with the binary bounce "You may not access token"

by creating a symbolic link
ln -s token /tmp/any
you can use the binary to read the file
token allow to log as flag08
getflag to retrieve the flag


further explanation
the binary strstr the name of the file with token
as long as the name file contain token it will prevent reading
the "You may not access %s" is hard coded
